# React Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based sorting algorithm visualizer built using React.js. The purpose of the project is to help users visualize how different sorting algorithms work and how they compare in terms of efficiency.
Try Here : https://ujjwald77.github.io/react-sorting-algo-visualizer/

## Features

- Supports visualization of several sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quicksort.
- Allows users to set the size of the input array and generate random arrays for sorting.
- Animates the sorting process to help users understand how the algorithms work step-by-step.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the project.

## Usage

- Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Set the size of the input array using the slider.
- Click the "Generate Array" button to generate a random input array.
- Click the "Sort" button to begin the sorting process.
- Watch the sorting animation to see how the algorithm works.
- View statistics about the algorithm's performance in the panel on the right.
